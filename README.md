Move view on "OnTouchEvent",

ACTION_DOWN: find now delta position.
ACTION_MOVE: using delta position and animation event to move view.

like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9398057/android-move-a-view-on-touch-move-action-move)

But i don't know how to supporting multiple touch ...

and now, i wanna make multiple color of path, so my solution use ArrayList saving multiple path and color.
